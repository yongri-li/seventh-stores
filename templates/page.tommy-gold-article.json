        "content": "It's around lunch time and we’ve just wrapped up shooting our new colourway ‘Coffee’ with Tommy Gold at Young Space Music Studios in Hackney, East London. A tired yet cheerful Tommy sits across from me, a chocolate brown beanie crowning his head while a black hoodie and puffer jacket encases him, in true London style. \n\nHaving grown up between Ladbroke Grove and Shepherds Bush in West London, Tommy's heritage has arguably defined his rich taste in music; his mother, who was adopted, is Kenyan, and his father is Egyptian-Persian. The couple met in the late 80s and Tommy came almost a decade later in 1998, the youngest of 3 siblings. \n\nHaving now played for Louis Vuitton, Boiler Room, Prada and Rimowa , to name a few, the young artist has an undisputed talent for influencing audiences with his dynamic mixes and high-spirited setlists. He’s become notably recognised for his ability to interpret the energy of a room, consistently creating a personal affair for everyone involved. \n\nOn first impression, Tommy is a very likable guy - what you see is what you get. Our conversation began with a mutual appreciation for authenticity and genuineness. “Ask me anything, I’m an open book,” Tommy insists, as I hit record at the beginning of our conversation. The DJ reflects on his earlier challenges in schooling, throughout his adolescence, he had never been able to settle in the education system, moving school three times before securing an internship at NTS radio. Granted, he had always had a love for music, sharing sounds with his father and siblings from an early age, Tommy mastered the craft of playing the guitar as a teen, as well as that often engaging in school music practices . \n\nThe late Virgil Abloh often talked about being a ‘tourist vs purist’, it’s clear Tommys pursuit of music was and is both intentional and organic, he has demonstrated he is extremely knowledgeable and well rounded in more than a few genres. The musician's passion was deepend when he was accepted for an internship when he was just 16, having misled NTS Radio station, suggesting he had left education, he made apparent that he was willing to take the role on full time. Tommy spent the next two years working on his craft, even having the opportunity to travel to LA to launch NTS radio there, at 17. “Femi, the owner of NTS radio, took me under his wing, he taught me everything there was to know,” he recalls. From then, it felt as though his mind had been made. This was it, music was what he was going to pursue, there was no back up plan.\n\nNow, almost nine years later, Tommy Gold is full of inspiration. \"I am only exhausted or uninspired until I start doing it again,\" he replies, when I enquire of any challenges he’s faced since his career has taken off. His confidence in his craft is neither loud nor haughty, but subtle, and full of optimism. On average, Tommy now plays two to four events per week, as well as working on various personal projects and occasionally, with private clients as a producer. His unapologetically tenacious attitude would make anyone contemplate if they really love what they do. “I know for sure that I couldn't do anything else. I know nothing else could make me as happy as music does,” he says. For now, the 25-year-old Tommy Gold is set on giving music everything he has. “If I'm still as inspired in 5 years as I am right now, I'm doing something right,” he says with an assured smile. \n\nChoosing Tommy to be a part of this launch for Seventh was logical, towards the end of our conversation the DJ somehow found a way to put into words perfectly how we felt: “I appreciate a brand that is universal, I think in many ways it translates to my music a lot. I want to make things that loads of people appreciate, I want things to be transcendental, make sense in different contexts, Seventh does that.” Simplicity can work anywhere, when done well, which is simultaneously what Seventh hopes to accomplish. For the young DJ, that has always been the dream for music, wanting things to work for a lot of different people and for people to be open to hearing something new. This collaboration represents an appreciation of simplicity and craft, which aligns perfectly with our Seventh ethos. And not only that, but learning to appreciate art, music, clothing in a different context - not just how it’s been handed to you.\n\nIntroducing @TommyGold for our release of our new ‘Coffee’ V2 tracksuit, captured by @Fraznn. \nIt’s been a pleasure working with Tommy Gold, London born and raised DJ and artist who has an undisputed talent for influencing audiences with his dynamic setlists. This collaboration represents an appreciation of simplicity and craft, which aligns perfectly with our Seventh ethos. Learning to appreciate art, music, clothing in a different context - not just how it’s been handed to you. \ninspired by Tommy Gold, captured by @Fraznn. \n\n“I appreciate a brand that is universal, I think in many ways it translates to my music a lot.
